# GITHUB-IS-DEPRECATED

## Why Github is deprecated?

Github is deprecated because I started usage of more safe and private code hosting: notabug.org
I'm StalinKali. All my current repositories are republished at notabug.org (StalinKali), gitlab.com (Dima-diep). There will be only updating of apt-repositories (linux-dark and termux-dark). Whenever, I will come out from my (current) services and accounts because I want more privacy and anonimity. Gitlab won't be updated whenever.
